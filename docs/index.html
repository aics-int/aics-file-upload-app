                    <p>
                        The FMS File Upload App is the graphical user interface application for uploading files 
                        into AICS's centralized file storage colloquially known as FMS. To search for or access the
                        uploaded files now in FMS you can use another AICS application, the
                        <a class="link" href="https://alleninstitute.github.io/aics-fms-file-explorer-app/">FMS File Explorer App.</a>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Files in FMS are best located by their 'annotations' (metadata about the file ex. I can upload an imaging file and
                        annotate it with the annotation "Program" giving the value that corresponds with the project I'm working on e.g. EMT,
                        Nucmorph, etc.). Every file in FMS is, by default, given some basic annotations ("Uploaded by", "Kind", "Type"), but
                        to better differentiate your files it is helpful to add additional annnotations which the FMS File Upload App allows
                        you to do.

                        it is another AICS application in which you can search for files by basic information, like their name or who uploaded it,
                        as well as any other metadata the file has been annotated with.

                        Note: Metadata about uploaded files can also be seen in the File Upload App by the user whom uploaded them. The metadata
                        can also be updated in this way.
