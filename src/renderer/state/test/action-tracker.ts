/**
 * Helper class for tracking Redux actions as they pass through the middleware stack. The internal class `_actions`,
 * exposed by the `actions` getter, contains some methods for working with the tracked actions list, including resetting
 * the list and checking if any actions have passed through the middleware stack that equals (or loosely matches) a
 * given action or list of actions. The purpose of the internal class is to be able to provide a different API to test
 * code than the API used by action tracking middleware, but simultaneously allow both to access the same state.
 *
 * Example:
 * In mock-redux-store.ts, a new ActionTracker instance is used in custom Redux middleware to track actions passed
 * through the middleware stack.
 *
 * Then, in test code:
 * // `actions` here comes from ActionTracker::actions
 * > const [store, logicMiddleware, actions] = createMockReduxStore();
 *
 * // before
 * > expect(actions.list).to.be.empty;
 *
 * // do action and wait for redux-logic to do its thing
 * > store.dispatch({ type: "FOO", payload: 1234 })
 * > await logicMiddleware.whenComplete();
 *
 * // after
 * > expect(actions.list).to.be.an("array").of.length(1);
 * > expect(actions.includes({ type: "FOO", payload: 1234 })).to.equal(true);
 * > expect(actions.matches({ payload: 1234 })).to.equal(true);
